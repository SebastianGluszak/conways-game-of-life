Project introduction: 
This project hopes to achieve an accurate representation of Conway's Game of Life written in the Rust programming language. Some goals in mind include making an good-looking and easy to use user interface and also implementing several shapes other than the square. This project was chosen because it is a simple concept that can further be built off of in many different ways to my own liking. The concept of the game itself and its results are interesting as well as fun to see visualized.

System overview: 
A functional project should allow the user to individually select the starting cells in Conway's Game of Life and to run the game using those selected cells. It should also allow the user to zoom in and out of the grid, select between differet shapes, adjust the time between evolution cycles, and pause + resume the game at any given moment. The project should implement the rules so that the game accurately represents Conway's Game of Life.

Timeline:
- Setup barebones project structure i.e. file structure
- Create barebones user interface (UI does not necessarily need to do anything at this point)
- Implement the original Conway's Game of Life using squares
- Improve user interface interface (UI should work at this point)
- Add new modifications to the game using different shapes or different rules
- Final touches / debugging

Possible challenges: Creating a good user interface; implementing rules correctly; dealing with never ending games.
